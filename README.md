# Parser written in Python for Alberta Energy Regulator ST1 and ST49 Reports

This is my first coding project. I decided to take on this challenge since I was interested in ingesting this data every day automatically. The challenge was that the files are text files with some structure and I needed the data in tabular format. This is no longer maintained since I decided to take up on learning Rust. I will be finishing this project in Rust to make it a more complete solution that performs all the original tasks in a single artifact.
