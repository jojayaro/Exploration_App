# Python scripts to parse data from AER ST1 and ST49 Reports

## Update 22-08-2021
All the data was moved to a MongoDB Database and now the script downloads the text files daily, parses them, and inserts the data into the database.

App in the following link pulls the data directly from database to simplify the whole process.
